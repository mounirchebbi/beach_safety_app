# Safety Zone Overlap Detection

## Overview
The Beach Safety App now includes automatic overlap detection for safety zones to prevent conflicting zones from being created in the same center.

## How It Works

### Backend Implementation
- **Location**: `backend/src/controllers/safetyZoneController.js`
- **Function**: Both `createSafetyZone` and `updateSafetyZone` functions now include overlap detection
- **Method**: Uses PostGIS `ST_Intersects` function to check for geometric overlaps
- **Response**: Returns HTTP 409 (Conflict) with detailed information about overlapping zones

### Frontend Implementation
- **Location**: `frontend/src/components/admin/NoSwimZoneManagement.tsx`
- **Error Handling**: Displays user-friendly error messages with specific overlapping zone names
- **Visual Feedback**: Existing zones are shown on the map with dashed borders during zone creation
- **User Guidance**: Clear instructions about overlap prevention

## Features

### 1. Automatic Overlap Detection
- Prevents creation of zones that overlap with existing zones
- Works for all zone types: no_swim, caution, safe
- Checks both creation and update operations

### 2. Visual Feedback
- Existing zones displayed on map during zone creation
- Dashed borders distinguish existing zones from new zone being created
- Color-coded by zone type for easy identification

### 3. User-Friendly Error Messages
- Specific error messages listing overlapping zone names
- Clear guidance on how to resolve overlaps
- Maintains existing error handling for other issues

### 4. Database-Level Validation
- Uses PostGIS spatial functions for accurate geometric overlap detection
- Handles complex polygon geometries correctly
- Excludes the current zone when updating (prevents self-overlap errors)

## Error Response Format

When overlap is detected, the API returns:

```json
{
  "error": "Safety zone overlaps with existing zones",
  "details": {
    "message": "The new safety zone overlaps with one or more existing zones",
    "overlappingZones": [
      {
        "id": "zone-uuid",
        "name": "Zone Name",
        "zone_type": "no_swim"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## User Experience

1. **Zone Creation**: Users see existing zones on the map with dashed borders
2. **Overlap Prevention**: System prevents creation of overlapping zones
3. **Clear Feedback**: Error messages specify which zones are causing conflicts
4. **Resolution Guidance**: Users are instructed to adjust location or radius

## Technical Details

### PostGIS Query
```sql
SELECT id, name, zone_type 
FROM safety_zones 
WHERE center_id = $1 
AND ST_Intersects(geometry, ST_GeomFromGeoJSON($2))
```

### Frontend Error Handling
```typescript
if (err.response?.status === 409 && err.response?.data?.details?.overlappingZones) {
  const overlappingZones = err.response.data.details.overlappingZones;
  const zoneNames = overlappingZones.map((zone: any) => 
    `${zone.name} (${zone.zone_type})`
  ).join(', ');
  setError(`Safety zone overlaps with existing zones: ${zoneNames}. Please adjust the location or radius to avoid overlap.`);
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Conflicting Zones**: Ensures no overlapping safety zones exist
2. **Improves Safety**: Reduces confusion about which zones apply where
3. **Better UX**: Clear visual feedback and error messages
4. **Data Integrity**: Maintains clean, non-overlapping zone data
5. **Scalable**: Works with any number of zones per center

## Testing

To test the overlap detection:

1. Create a safety zone in Center Admin â†’ No-Swim Zone Management
2. Try to create another zone that overlaps with the first
3. Verify that the system prevents creation and shows appropriate error message
4. Adjust the location or radius to avoid overlap
5. Successfully create the non-overlapping zone
