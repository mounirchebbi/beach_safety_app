RECENT FIXES (June 29, 2025)
============================

🔧 AUTOMATIC FLAG UPDATE BUG FIX
- Issue: "Failed to trigger automatic update" error with "result.data is undefined"

- Fix Applied:
  * Updated `triggerAutomaticFlagUpdate()` method in `frontend/src/services/api.ts`
  * Fixed `handleAutoUpdate()` function in `frontend/src/components/admin/SafetyManagement.tsx`
  * Corrected system-wide flag management methods
- Result: ✅ Automatic flag updates now work correctly
